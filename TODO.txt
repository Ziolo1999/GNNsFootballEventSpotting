PLAN:
-> Prepare better annotations prepare some plots that will demonstrate some distributions. Focus on for example counter pressing.
-> Erase the receptive field from the data.
-> Change data loader so it will provide also negative sampling 
-> Prepare the model so that it will learn only segmentation module.
-> Design the architecture that will capture temporal patterns from segmentation module to predict the event. Think about applying recurrent neural net. 





-> Check the loss values on the original data,
-> Optimise data reader too much RAM,
-> Verify the evaluation part takes more GPU RAM then training part?
-> Optimise loss calculations, takes most of the memory and slows down 
the training

Things to cover:
-> Animation for results interpretation
-> Get mAP statistics maybe get more create the wrapper
-> Explore the parameters how they work

-> Elaborate on using temporal graph neural networks simple models issue how to train them 
-> Experiment on the model 

-> Explain which annotations use and start thinking about the parameters based on the game u received


Further steps:
-> Generate better annotations
-> Verify synchronisation
-> Increase smoothing
-> Probability of choosing annotations as we have uneven distribution of them
-> Play more with K parameters
-> 1 seconds of prediction corresponds to the the 300/15
