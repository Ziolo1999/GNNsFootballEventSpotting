PLAN:
1st
-> Include dead and pass for annotations (found a bug with annotations)
-> Standardise features?
-> Remove threshold for edges 
-> Generate augmented data, by mirroring actions
2nd
-> Transfer learning: learn model for all then fine tune to specific events
-> For single models different way of choosing an anchor so negative samples were chosen
