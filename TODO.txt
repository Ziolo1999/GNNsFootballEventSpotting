-> Check the loss values on the original data,
-> Optimise data reader too much RAM,
-> Verify the evaluation part takes more GPU RAM then training part?
-> Optimise loss calculations, takes most of the memory and slows down 
the training

Things to cover:
-> Animation for results interpretation
-> Get mAP statistics maybe get more create the wrapper
-> Explore the parameters how they work

-> Elaborate on using temporal graph neural networks simple models issue how to train them 
-> Experiment on the model 

-> Explain which annotations use and start thinking about the parameters based on the game u received
