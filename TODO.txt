PLAN:
-> Grid Search to determine the best chunk size increase K-params for rare events,
-> Train with weight loss,
-> Train fine-tuned models,
-> Prepare the metrics that will evaluate the segmentation module,
-> Decide on error for annotations,

-> Train these three models with the base spotting module, should the segmentation be frozen?
-> Select the best one in terms of MAP score and use it to develop the spotting algorithm by adding 		some LSTM modules. 

-> Train the model for one class to get the reference point
